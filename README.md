my first project on GitHub.

This project focuses on the automated classification of social media profiles using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). With the rapid growth of social media, identifying and categorizing profiles (e.g., personal, business, influencer) has become essential for targeted marketing, content moderation, and user behavior analysis.

Key Features:

Utilizes CNNs to analyze profile images and post content.

Incorporates textual feature extraction using NLP techniques for hybrid modeling.

Trained on a labeled dataset of various profile types across platforms.

Evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Designed to support real-time applications like automated moderation and profile analytics tools.
